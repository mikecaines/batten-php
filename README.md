# batten-php

An architectural toolkit to support the server-side of a MVC micro-framework.

Batten provides various classes, functions, and patterns which facilitate routing, component resolution, modularization,
extension, and more. It can be used in a web-server and terminal environment.

NOTE: This package not usually used directly. It is instead used as part of a higher level package, such as
[batten-stub](https://github.com/mikecaines/batten-stub/). The batten package includes only the bare essentials
on which you can build your own structure.

This package is currently in *alpha*.
